# Master Planner

## Description

This calendar will keep track of all your events in you work hours from 9 AM to 5 PM. Some essential features shown here are your local time, a color indicator for when the hour has passed or has yet to come, and a Local Storage function that will hold on to your plans in case you close the site on accident.


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
